# CS255-Project-One

## Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

This project was designed for a client that wanted a solution for students to practice their written and practical driving tests before they took their actual tests at the DMV. In particular, the client wanted an online based system that could allow for managing students and their drivers. They wanted a cloud based system that would be accessed by web browsers and for appointment creation to be done over the phone.

## What did you do particularly well?

In this project I personally felt like I did my best work on the GANTT chart I created for the timeline of the project. I felt I had made it very clear what was to be done when. It was color coded for different teams to work on different portions on the project when tasks were to be done in parallel.

## If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

Out of everything in the project, I could have added more detail to the non-functional requirements. I could have added more non-functional requirments, as I feel like I had added the minimum number required.

## How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Reading the transcript and listening to the client is the best wayt to get the information required to design a system to the client's need. In doing so, I can reread the interview so that I can pick out key points of what the client wants and implement it into the design. Without doing so, the final product might come out not meeting the requirements for the client.

## How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

When designing software, I like to take a top down approach where I like to think how I want the final product to look then design from there down to the base level. In the future I would think about activity diagrams when designing functions and use cases. Having a clear design and flow to a function is one of the best and clearest ways to design a function.
